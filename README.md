# Legend of Zelda: The Code Catacombs

## This game was created for our final term project in our Elements of Computer Programming II class during the 2025 spring semester at Delaware State University, under the guidance of Professor Marwan Rasamny. We created this game while learning Java, and it was not only our first time making a project of this size in Java, but also our first time building a game. Although it's a bit rough around the edges, we hope you still enjoy it. The game was made using Greenfoot, a Java program designed for creating games and simulations. You can download it from the official website at www.greenfoot.org and download the repository to play our game.

In the Code Catacombs game, you play as Link or two other chosen characters, exploring a world, battling enemies, collecting potions, and leveling up along the way. Your goal is to find and defeat four mini-bosses, collect the dropped keys to decode the secret message, and then challenge the final boss, Dr. Rasamny himself.
