# Legend of Zelda: The Code Catacombs

## This game was made for our final term project in our Elements of Computer Programming II class during the 2025 spring semester at Delaware State University under the guidence of Professor Marwan Rasamny. We created this game all while learning java and it being not only our first time creating project of this with size java but, also creating a game. So it is very rough around the edges, but we hope you still enjoy it. The game was made using Greenfoot a Java program designed for creating games and simulations. You can download it from the official website at www.greenfoot.org and download the repository to play our game.

In The Code Catacombs game you play as Link, or two other chosen characters exploring a world battling enemies, collecting potions, and getting leveling up along the way. Your goal is to find and defeat 4 mini-bosses and collect the dropped keys to decode the secret message and challenge the final boss, Dr Rasamny (our professor for the class).
